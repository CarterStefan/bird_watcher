Welcome CarterStefan,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!

## ADD IMAGES OF DEVICES ONCE FINISHED HERE ##
 
Bird watcher is my third milestone project as part of my Full Stack Web Development Course with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). This project focuses on "Data Centric Development" and will put into practice what I have learned over the last couple of modules.
 
## Table of Contents
1. [**Project overview**](#project-overview)
2. [**UX**](#ux)
  - [**User Stories**](#user-stories)
 
---
 
## Project overview
Bird Watcher was built using [Python](https://www.python.org/) - programming language, [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) - a Python framework & [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) - a document-based database for the storage and retriving of data.
 
 
## UX
 
Bird Watcher is an online web application. It is focused on users which have an interest in bird watching, both experienced and beginners. Using Bird Watcher, users will be able to:

- Register an account
- See a list of all birds on the database
- See more information about a particular bird
- Add a bird to the database
- Report an error to the site for admin to change
- Search for a bird by name
- Search for a bird by category
- Add a bird to the users list of seen birds
 
The website will be easy to use, and have a familiar feel on all pages throughout the site.
 
### User Stories

- ##### Bird Watcher - Experienced
- I enjoy going out to see all kinds of birds.
- As a user, I would like a place to be able to record the birds that I see when out. I have a notebook, but I want a one stop place which is easy to use. I should be able to find a bird and mark it as seen. I should then also be able to see a list of all the birds I have spotted in one age.
 
- ##### Bird Watcher - Beginner
- I enjoy going to see the birds at my local nature reserve.
- As a user, I would like a place to be able to record the birds that I seen in the hope of seeing all bird species in the UK one day.
- I would like to see a list of common birds and mark them off once I have seen them. As a beginner, I should be able to click on a bird to see more information about that particular species. This should apply to both birds seen and not yet seen, so that I will be able to see where to find all the birds.
 
- ##### Website Admin
- As admin of the site I want to be in control of any errors on the site. I will add functionality to the site so that a user can report an error of information about a bird. I will then be able to look at the error and correct any legitimate issues myself.
